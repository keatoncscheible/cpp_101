# C++17 Features

The **C++17 Features** section of the C++ 101 tutorial series introduces the enhancements and improvements made in the C++17 standard. C++17 continues to build upon the features introduced in C++14 and brings new functionalities to make C++ programming more efficient and user-friendly.

## Structured Bindings

In this part of the section, we'll explore structured bindings, a feature that simplifies working with tuples and other data structures. Structured bindings allow us to unpack the elements of a data structure, such as a tuple or a pair, directly into individual variables. This results in cleaner and more readable code, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

To understand the concept of structured bindings and see practical examples of how to use them effectively, you can explore the [structured_bindings.cpp](structured_bindings.cpp) file.

## std::optional and std::variant

Next, we'll delve into the std::optional and std::variant types, which are part of the C++17 standard library. These new types provide better alternatives for handling optional values and variant types. std::optional allows us to represent optional values, while std::variant enables us to work with variant types that can hold different types of values.

To see how std::optional and std::variant can be used to handle optional and variant data in a concise and type-safe manner, you can refer to the [std_optional_and_std_variant.cpp](std_optional_and_std_variant.cpp) file.

By exploring the C++17 features, you'll gain valuable insights into the latest advancements in the C++ language. These features can significantly enhance your C++ programming experience and empower you to write more expressive and robust code.
