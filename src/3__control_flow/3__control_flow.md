# Control Flow

The **Control Flow** section in the C++ 101 tutorial series covers the mechanisms that allow us to control the flow of execution in a C++ program. Control flow statements enable the program to make decisions and repeat certain actions based on specific conditions.

## If-else Statements

In this part of the section, we will explore the concept of **if-else** statements in C++. These conditional statements allow the program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false. We will learn how to write if-else statements and understand their syntax and usage in various scenarios.

For code examples and practical implementations related to if-else statements, please refer to the [if_else_statements.cpp](if_else_statements.cpp) file.

## Switch Statements

Next, we will dive into **switch** statements in C++. The switch statement is another way to make decisions based on the value of an expression. It allows us to choose from multiple possible execution paths depending on the value of the expression. We will explore how to write switch statements and their comparison with if-else statements.

For code examples and demonstrations regarding switch statements, please check the [switch_statements.cpp](switch_statements.cpp) file.

## Loops (for, while, do-while)

In the final part of this section, we will cover different types of loops in C++. Loops are essential for repeating a specific set of instructions multiple times. We will learn about three types of loops: **for**, **while**, and **do-while** loops. Each type of loop has its unique syntax and usage, allowing us to implement different repetitive tasks efficiently.

For code examples and practical implementations of loops, please refer to the [loops.cpp](loops.cpp) file.

By mastering control flow statements and loops, you will gain the ability to add decision-making and repetitive behavior to your C++ programs. This section will empower you to write more dynamic and interactive applications.
