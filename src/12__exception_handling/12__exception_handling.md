# Exception Handling

In the **Exception Handling** section of the C++ 101 tutorial series, we will learn about dealing with exceptional situations that may occur during program execution. Exception handling is a powerful mechanism that allows us to gracefully handle errors and unexpected scenarios in our code.

## try-catch blocks

In this part, we'll dive into the concept of `try-catch` blocks. A `try` block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs within the `try` block, the program jumps to the corresponding `catch` block, where the exception can be handled. This prevents the program from terminating abruptly and allows us to provide meaningful error messages or take appropriate actions.

To see practical examples and code demonstrations of `try-catch` blocks, refer to the [try_catch_blocks.cpp](try_catch_blocks.cpp) file.

## Custom exception classes

Next, we'll explore custom exception classes. C++ allows us to create our own exception classes by inheriting from the standard `std::exception` class or its derived classes. Creating custom exception classes enables us to define specific exception types for different scenarios in our program. This helps us provide detailed error information and handle exceptions more effectively.

To understand the process of creating and using custom exception classes, check out the [custom_exception_classes.cpp](custom_exception_classes.cpp) file.

By learning about exception handling, you will be better equipped to write robust and reliable C++ programs that can gracefully handle unexpected situations and errors. Let's dive into exception handling and make our code more resilient!
