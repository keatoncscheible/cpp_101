# Object-Oriented Programming

The **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** section in the C++ 101 tutorial series introduces you to the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and how they are implemented in C++. OOP is a paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It enables you to model real-world entities and their interactions, making code more organized, modular, and easier to maintain.

## Classes and Objects

Classes are user-defined data types that encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit. They serve as blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of the class. In this section, we will cover how to define classes, create objects, and access their member variables and functions. Understanding classes and objects is the foundation of object-oriented programming.

For code examples and practical implementations related to classes and objects, please refer to the [classes_and_objects.cpp](classes_and_objects.cpp) file.

## Constructors and Destructors

Constructors are special member functions in a class that are called when an object is created. They allow you to initialize object data members and perform any setup required for the object to be in a valid state. Destructors, on the other hand, are called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted. They are responsible for releasing any resources acquired by the object during its lifetime.

For code examples and practical implementations related to constructors and destructors, please check the [constructors_and_destructors.cpp](constructors_and_destructors.cpp) file.

## Member Functions and Data Members

Member functions are functions declared within a class and operate on the class's data members. They encapsulate behavior and actions that the class can perform. Data members are variables defined within a class and represent the state of the objects. In this section, we will explore how to define member functions and data members, as well as their access specifiers.

For code examples and practical implementations related to member functions and data members, please refer to the [member_functions_and_data_members.cpp](member_functions_and_data_members.cpp) file.

Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that promotes code reusability, maintainability, and organization. By understanding classes, objects, constructors, and member functions, you'll be equipped to design and implement complex C++ programs following OOP principles.
