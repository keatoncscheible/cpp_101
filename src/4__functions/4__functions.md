# Functions

The **Functions** section in the C++ 101 tutorial series introduces the concept of functions, a fundamental building block of C++ programs. Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called from other parts of the program. They allow us to organize our code into smaller, manageable units and promote reusability.

## Defining Functions

In this part of the section, we will explore how to **define functions** in C++. We'll learn about the syntax and structure of functions, including their return types, function name, and parameters. You'll understand how to write custom functions to perform specific operations, which can be easily invoked from various places in your program.

For code examples and practical demonstrations related to defining functions, please refer to the [defining_functions.cpp](defining_functions.cpp) file.

## Function Parameters (Pass by Value/Reference)

Next, we'll dive into the concept of **function parameters** in C++. Function parameters allow us to pass data into a function so that it can operate on that data. We'll cover two types of function parameters: **pass by value** and **pass by reference**. Understanding the difference between these two methods is crucial for efficient memory management and avoiding unnecessary data duplication.

For code examples and practical implementations of function parameters, please check the [function_parameters.cpp](function_parameters.cpp) file.

## Function Overloading

In the final part of this section, we will explore **function overloading** in C++. Function overloading enables us to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists. This powerful feature allows us to create functions that perform similar tasks with different data types or numbers of arguments.

For code examples and demonstrations regarding function overloading, please refer to the [function_overloading.cpp](function_overloading.cpp) file.

By mastering functions and their various aspects, you will gain the ability to write modular and organized C++ programs. Functions play a central role in C++, and their proper usage can significantly enhance the readability and maintainability of your code.
