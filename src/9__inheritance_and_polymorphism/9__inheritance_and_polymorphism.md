# Inheritance and Polymorphism

The **Inheritance and Polymorphism** section of the C++ 101 tutorial series delves into essential object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, inheritance, and polymorphism. Inheritance is a powerful mechanism that allows you to create a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors. Polymorphism, on the other hand, enables a single interface to represent different types or classes.

## Base and Derived Classes

In the first part of this section, we will explore inheritance and the relationship between base and derived classes. You will learn how to derive new classes from existing ones, inheriting their attributes and member functions. This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, facilitating code reuse and organization.

To see inheritance in action, check out the [base_and_derived_classes.cpp](base_and_derived_classes.cpp) file.

## Virtual Functions and Dynamic Polymorphism

Next, we'll dive into virtual functions and dynamic polymorphism, an essential aspect of OOP. Virtual functions enable you to define a base class function that can be overridden by derived classes. This dynamic binding allows you to call the appropriate function based on the type of object at runtime, enabling flexible and extensible code.

To understand virtual functions and dynamic polymorphism, refer to the [virtual_functions_and_dynamic_polymorphism.cpp](virtual_functions_and_dynamic_polymorphism.cpp) file.

By mastering inheritance and polymorphism, you can create more flexible and maintainable code by promoting code reuse and building robust class hierarchies.
