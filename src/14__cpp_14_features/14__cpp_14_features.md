# C++14 Features

The **C++14 Features** section of the C++ 101 tutorial series explores some of the new features introduced in the C++14 standard. C++14 builds upon the foundation of C++11 and brings additional enhancements to the language, making it more expressive and convenient to use.

## Generic Lambdas

In this part of the section, we'll dive into generic lambdas, a powerful addition to C++14. Generic lambdas allow us to write lambda functions that can accept arguments of different types using the `auto` keyword. This significantly enhances the flexibility and reusability of lambda expressions, making them more versatile than ever before.

To see practical examples and understand the concept of generic lambdas, you can explore the [generic_lambdas.cpp](generic_lambdas.cpp) file.

## Variable Templates

Next, we'll explore variable templates, another feature introduced in C++14. Variable templates enable us to define generic variables with a specified type that can be used with different types. By using variable templates, we can achieve type-safe and efficient code without the need for explicit type casting or inheritance.

To delve into variable templates and see how they can simplify your code, you can refer to the [variable_templates.cpp](variable_templates.cpp) file.

By mastering the C++14 features, you'll be equipped with even more modern tools and techniques to write expressive, concise, and efficient C++ code. Let's dive into the world of C++14 and explore its powerful capabilities!
