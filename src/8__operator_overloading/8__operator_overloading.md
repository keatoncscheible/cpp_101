# Operator Overloading

In the **Operator Overloading** section of the C++ 101 tutorial series, we will explore the powerful concept of operator overloading. C++ allows you to redefine the behavior of standard operators, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=), and assignment operators (=), for user-defined data types.

## Overloading Arithmetic, Comparison, and Assignment Operators

In the first part of this section, we will learn how to overload arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators for custom data types. This enables you to perform arithmetic operations, like addition and subtraction, on objects of your own classes. Additionally, you can customize the comparison operators to define how objects are compared for equality or ordering.

To see operator overloading in action, check out the [overloading_arithmetic_comparison_and_assignment_operators.cpp](overloading_arithmetic_comparison_and_assignment_operators.cpp) file.

## Friend Functions

Next, we'll explore the concept of friend functions in C++. Friend functions are non-member functions that are granted access to the private and protected members of a class. They are commonly used in operator overloading to access the private data members of two different objects and perform the required operations.

To understand the implementation of friend functions in operator overloading scenarios, refer to the [friend_functions.cpp](friend_functions.cpp) file.

Operator overloading allows you to create more intuitive and expressive code, making your classes behave like built-in types. By understanding how to properly overload operators, you can enhance the usability and maintainability of your C++ code.
